	This code can help you to spy every server you want to spy üïµÔ∏èüïµÔ∏èüïµÔ∏è<BR>
	The files are separated and should be opened individually because not all of them are needed 24/7. This allows you to start them separately. Enjoy now!<BR>
	<BR>PS: Don't spy on your friends, it's bad, but only your enemies (which is also bad), but <strong>PEACE</strong> in this crazy world
